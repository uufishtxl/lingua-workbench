      <title>What is Translation Manager?</title>
      <p>The <term>Translation Manager</term> is a utility page for managing translations across all your audio slices. It identifies slices that are missing Chinese translations and allows you to translate them in bulk using AI.</p>

      <title>Missing Translations</title>
      <p>A slice is considered "missing translation" when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It has been transcribed (has English text)</li>
        <li>No Chinese translation has been added yet</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These slices cannot be effectively reviewed until they have translations.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>AI Translation</title>
      <p>Translation Manager uses DeepSeek AI to generate contextual Chinese translations. The AI considers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The original English text</li>
        <li>Common idioms and colloquial expressions</li>
        <li>Natural Chinese phrasing</li>
      </ul>

      <title>When to Use</title>
      <p>Use Translation Manager when you have accumulated multiple slices without translations and want to process them efficiently in one batch, rather than translating each slice individually.</p>
